### Run App

For starting the app you simply run `make` command in your termnial and visit `localhost:8888` in your browser.

### Login for creating posts

Visit the secret room by visiting `localhost:8888/admin` where no one can bother you in writing your superhero thoughts.

For the first timehe app will redirect you to `localhost:8888/admin/login` and ask you to write your login and password. You should provide you admin credentials just to prove you are the superhero.
