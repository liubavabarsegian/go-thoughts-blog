# SuperHero Blog

SuperHero Blog - is a place where you can write your superhero thoughs without looking back. 

### Run App

For starting the app you simply run `make` command in your termnial and visit `localhost:8888` in your browser.

### Login for creating posts

Visit the secret room by visiting `localhost:8888/admin` where no one can bother you in writing your superhero thoughts.

For the first timehe app will redirect you to `localhost:8888/admin/login` and ask you to write your login and password. You should provide you admin credentials just to prove you are the superhero.

Don't worry! You won't need to login every time because this smart app uses **Cookies** for remembering you when you login!

For safety purposes, you can always `localhost:8888/admin/logout`.

### Create posts

Now you are ready to create posts with a **Markdown support**, WoW!

I had to implemen a pagination of posts so people don't get too much of your awesomeness.

### Rate Limiting

If you have a cool site, you must protect ourselves from the bad guys trying to bring it down!
API Rate Limiter limits 100 clients request per second for now.
